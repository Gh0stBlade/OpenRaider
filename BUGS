 BUGS ( Updated 2002.12.24 )
 ==================================================================

 ### Open bugs  ###################################################

 [2003.05.11]
	* New animation code can cause segfault on pushing wall
	  repeatedly to cause a bad event animation ( rare )

 [Short list] No 'Z' in kb system?
        * Working on System wrappers soon so that will be looked at

 [Short list] OpenAL has problems with gdb and segfaults
	* Disable OpenAL in OpenRaider.init if this happens,
	  this is considered a bug in OpenAL
	* Try a different version of OpenAL package

 [2002.12.22] SkyMesh isn't loaded or rendered correctly
        * New World/Render style is to blame

 [2002.08.16] Many levels have room polygons misrendered
	* Likely caused by the new room mesh cache system
	  which is still being retooled
	* Black walls caused by other than vertex color values
        * Vertex colors for TR3-TR4 rooms messed up
          ( Temp hack adjusts to bright values )


 ### Closed bugs  #################################################

 [????.??.??] TR4, TR3 Segfault on some level's load in ModelSetup
        * Seems several meshes w/o vertices are followed by
	  an invalid mesh that claims to have polygons
	  yet doesn't
	* Note some TR 'meshes' are just markers for
	  particle fx and etc
        * Reproducable with karnak1.tr4
	* FIXED by accounting for -1 for NULL counter use in 
	  some TR paks

 [2002.01.04] TR4 Some levels segfault on load
	* More animation frames generated than exist
	  caused by invalid frame_offset
	* Reproducable with angkor1.tr4
	* FIXED by using new algothrim for anim frame loading

 [2002.01.04] TR3 rendering white in textures with alpha black
 [2002.01.04] TR1 rendering all textures black
	* Used to work fine, but so much as changed...
	* Try looking at texture loading first
	* Then try looking at vertex lighting
	* Reproducable with level1.phd, shore.tr2
	* FIXED fast texture cache for older tombraider data
	  loaded textures before they were generated as
	  32bpp textures ( they were all alpha )

 [2002.01.03] TR4 'Killed'
	* FIXED try not loading OpenAL to save some memory
	  can't really 'fix' lack of memory

 [????.??.??] TR2, TR3 Polygon coloring is wrong
	* Seems to be caused by vertex coloring
	* FIXED ambient light wasn't set back to WHITE
	  before mesh rendering

 [????.??.??] TR4 fread(buffer, 2, 1546, fp) returned 3092
        * Bad fread emulation checking? ( TR4 uses compressed data )
        * Seems to be bad linking, works correctly after rebuilds
	* FIXED uncompressed buffer size wasn't passed in DEBUG code

 [????.??.??] NormalArray segfault
        * Only happens in FastGL mode OR when Sky meshes are enabled
        * mesh->oglTexturedRectangleNormals becomes NULL after first frame
        * FIXED No longer using tombraider normal arrays in new renderer
